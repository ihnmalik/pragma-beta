                        Our payment plan is specifically tailored for bootstrapping founders. 
                        You can get started on your project with a 14% down payment while the 
                        rest of the development cost is spread over 18 months. With the advised 
                        scope, you should have a first version within 5 to 8 months, so you can 
                        test your market and decide whether you want to pursue. At best, your 
                        project gets the traction you’re aiming for and starts paying for its 
                        own development, at worst you can cancel the next month, with up to 
                        60% of the (built) project’s cost forgiven.
